    "\n",
    "The **course Question Reality**, taught by Marcelo Gleiser, is based on his book **The Island of Knowledge and addresses some of the deepest questions in science and philosophy**, questioning the **nature of reality**, the **structure of the world**, and our **role in the universe**.\n",

    "**Course Structure**\n",
    "The course is divided into three main modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cosmos** – **Explores the evolution of our understanding of the universe**, from the theories of the ancient Greeks to the Big Bang and the concept of the Multiverse.\n",
    "* **Matter** – **Analyzes the concept of matter**, starting from Greek **atomistic philosophy** to **quantum mechanic**s and the search for fundamental particles at CERN.\n",
    "* **Mind** – Investigates the **nature of mathematics**, **computers and the mystery** of human consciousness."

    "\n",
    "The question **“What is reality?”** is **complex and deeply thought-provoking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions of Reality**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oxford Dictionary (2005)**: Reality is “the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or theoretical idea.”\n",
    "- **Wikipedia**: Reality includes **everything that exists or has existed**, regardless of whether it is observable or comprehensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrasting Views**:\n",
    "- Reality is what we believe it to be.\n",
    "- Thoughts, dreams, and emotions are part of reality.\n",
    "- Only tangible physical objects belong to reality.\n",
    "- Science is the only tool that can fully explain reality.\n",

    "**Is there an “ultimate reality,”** the definitive basis of all that exists? Can we truly understand it in its entirety?\n"

    "**Can We Understand Reality?**\n",
    "According to astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser, **reality may forever remain beyond our grasp**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perception and Reality**\n",
    "* **Our senses act as antennas** that **capture information from the surrounding environment** and **transmit it to the brain**, which **synthesizes it to build an idea of ​​reality**.\n",
    "* However, this perception is manipulable: drugs and chemicals can alter the way we perceive the world, leading us to believe we see hidden aspects of reality (e.g. psychedelic experiences narrated by Aldous Huxley in The Doors of Perception).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Role of Science**\n",
    "Our **perception of reality is limited**, but **science acts as an amplifier of reality**, allowing us to see **beyond sensory limitations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Limit of Knowledge**\n",
    "* **There is always something beyond our tools of investigation**: technology advances, but a part of reality remains elusive.\n",
    "* **The illusion of total knowledge**: believing that we can arrive at a definitive understanding of reality is an act of naive optimism, perhaps dictated by fear of the unknown.\n",
    "* **Scientific humility**: as Einstein argued, we must accept that our understanding of the world will always be imperfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true value lies not in finding a definitive answer to the question “what is reality?”, but in the **continuous search for knowledge**."

    "## **The Birth of Philosophy and the Search for Reality**\n",
    "Marcelo Gleiser describes how **humanity has always sought to understand and control nature**, moving **from mythological explanations to rational and scientific ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **From Myths to Reason**\n",
    "**20,000 years ago**, natural phenomena were **unpredictable and inexplicable**. In an attempt to control them, early civilizations attributed divine will to natural events.\n",
    "The first agricultural societies (Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians) linked power to a **cosmic order**, often **embodied by divine figures such as the Pharaohs**.\n",
    "- **Myths served as pre-scientific explanations of reality**: they linked the sensible world to a divine realm without time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Talete di Mileto**, first natural philosopher. He proposed that **everything was made of water**, he started the **philosophy of becoming**, **nature is in constant transformation**.\n",
    "2. **Anassimandro**, proposed that the **fundamental element of the universe was not material**, but an indefinite entity called **\"the Infinite\" (Ápeiron)**. The universe, according to him, functioned as a **mechanism governed by natural laws**, anticipating the **idea of ​​a deterministic cosmos**.\n",
    "3. **Pitagora**, he saw the world in terms of **numbers and mathematical relationships**, everything in nature could be explained through **numerical patterns and proportions**. \n",
    "4. **Parmenide**, He opposed **Thales' idea of ​​continuous change**. The **true reality** was **immutable and eternal** (Being). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Beginning of Science and Rational Philosophy**\n",
    "These early philosophers sought to explain reality using reasoning, rather than myths and beliefs. Their ideas would influence Plato, who would later expand on the nature of reality in his own thinking.\n"
