    "* **The illusion of total knowledge**: believing that we can arrive at a definitive understanding of reality is an act of naive optimism, perhaps dictated by fear of the unknown.\n",
    "* **Scientific humility**: as Einstein argued, we must accept that our understanding of the world will always be imperfect.\n",

    "Marcelo Gleiser describes how **humanity has always sought to understand and control nature**, moving **from mythological explanations to rational and scientific ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **From Myths to Reason**\n",
    "**20,000 years ago**, natural phenomena were **unpredictable and inexplicable**. In an attempt to control them, early civilizations attributed divine will to natural events.\n",
    "The first agricultural societies (Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians) linked power to a **cosmic order**, often **embodied by divine figures such as the Pharaohs**.\n",
    "- **Myths served as pre-scientific explanations of reality**: they linked the sensible world to a divine realm without time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Talete di Mileto**, first natural philosopher. He proposed that **everything was made of water**, he started the **philosophy of becoming**, **nature is in constant transformation**.\n",
    "2. **Anassimandro**, proposed that the **fundamental element of the universe was not material**, but an indefinite entity called **\"the Infinite\" (Ápeiron)**. The universe, according to him, functioned as a **mechanism governed by natural laws**, anticipating the **idea of ​​a deterministic cosmos**.\n",
    "3. **Pitagora**, he saw the world in terms of **numbers and mathematical relationships**, everything in nature could be explained through **numerical patterns and proportions**. \n",
    "4. **Parmenide**, He opposed **Thales' idea of ​​continuous change**. The **true reality** was **immutable and eternal** (Being). \n",
    "\n",

    "These early philosophers sought to explain reality using reasoning, rather than myths and beliefs. Their ideas would influence Plato, who would later expand on the nature of reality in his own thinking.\n"

    "\n",
    "### **The Allegory of the Cave**\n",
    "- **Imagine people who have been chained since birth inside a cav**e, unable to move and unable to see anything other than a wall in front of them.\n",

    "Plato did not dwell much on the structure of the cosmos, but his student **Aristotle** developed a detailed theory, which remained the dominant model until the 16th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. The Geocentric Model**\n",
    "- **The Earth at the Center** → Aristotle imagined the cosmos as an **onion**, with the Earth at the center and the known planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) orbiting it.\n",
    "- **The Sphere of Fixed Stars** → Beyond Saturn was the sphere of fixed stars, which looked like crystals set in a celestial dome.\n",
    "- **The Crystalline Spheres** → The planets were set in transparent spheres that revolved around the Earth, dragging them with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Two Realities and Two Types of Gravity**\n",
    "Aristotle divided the universe into two regions:\n",
    "- **Under the Moon (terrestrial world)** → Dominated by the **four elements** (Earth, Water, Air, Fire). Here everything changed and transformed.\n",
    "- **Above the Moon (celestial world)** → Composed of a fifth element, the **ether** or **quintessence**, eternal and immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This division also influenced gravity:\n",
    "- **On Earth** → Things fell because their natural movement was to return to their place (e.g. stones fall, fire rises).\n",
    "- **In the sky** → Celestial bodies moved **in perfect circles**, because circular motion was considered natural and perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. The First Unmoved Mover**\n",
    "Aristotle addressed the problem of the **first cause**:\n",
    "- Why does the cosmos move?\n",
    "- Who gave the first impulse?\n",
    "\n",
    "His answer was the **Primum Mobile**, an external sphere that transmitted motion to the entire universe. The **unmoved mover**, a divine entity, gave rise to this motion without moving itself.\n",

    "- **Tycho Brahe**, a Danish astronomer with immense financial resources, built **instruments of unprecedented precision** to observe the sky with the naked eye (telescopes did not exist until 1608).\n",
    "- **1572 - Brahe's Supernova** → A sudden “new star” appeared in the sky.\n",
    "- Aristotle argued that the heavens could not change, but Brahe proved that this star was located **beyond the Moon**, disproving Aristotle's separation between the terrestrial and celestial worlds.\n",

    "\n",

    "After Brahe's discoveries, the Aristotelian model was revealed to be **deeply flawed**:\n",

    "- There were no **crystalline spheres** carrying the planets.\n",

    "## **Conversation with David Kaiser**\n",
    "\n",
    "The interview with **David Kaiser**, professor of Physics and History of Science at MIT, explores the concept of reality and the limits of its understanding. Kaiser recalls a famous quote by **Einstein** – *\"The Lord is subtle, but not malicious.\"* – to emphasize how nature follows precise, often hidden patterns that we can investigate through science. Although these patterns are not immediately obvious, the possibility of discovering them is what makes the exploration of reality so fascinating. However, the question arises: is there an end point in knowledge? Kaiser suggests not. The idea of ​​an **ultimate nature of reality** is a limitation imposed by our mind, not necessarily by reality itself. The complexity of the universe could be **infinite**, and the real limit is our ability to understand it. As in relativity, standing still in the search would mean letting time and reality move on without us. Knowledge and curiosity are the **engine that allows us to truly experience the world**, since only by exploring can we take reality from its overlapping of possibilities to a concrete form of understanding."
